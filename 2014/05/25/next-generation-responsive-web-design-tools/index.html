	<div><p>To prepare for a talk about the changing roles of designers and developers, given at HOW Interactive a few months back, I interviewed 20+ web shops. Validated by my own experience, I found that many of them faced challenges fitting responsive design into their workflow, and the role of most web designers had changed to include coding in some form or another.</p>
<p>At least half of the designers knew HTML and CSS well but wanted a more visual way to get at it. Well, a new generation of visual responsive design tools has arrived. These responsive design tools are for anyone who understands HTML and CSS (or is willing to learn) and wants to visually design a responsive website — and have code to show for it.</p>
<p>Some of the newest and most notable visual responsive website builders are Webflow, Adobe Edge Reflow CC and Macaw. Yes, a million others are out there, including Squarespace, FROONT and Easel, but we’ll focus on a few in this article. My intention isn’t to champion these tools, but rather to familiarize you with them and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>For the record, I’m a front-end developer who hand-codes responsive websites using several frameworks and my own code as a starting point (along with WordPress). I’ve always been leery of generated code, for good reason (remember GoLive?), but I also understand that tools like these have a time, a place and, yes, an audience. You could use one of these tools in the design process to create responsive comps, regardless of whether you intend to use the generated code. I’ve even taken to using a few for quick prototyping. Blasphemy!</p>
<p>So, let’s have a look, starting with Webflow.</p>
<h2 id="Webflow">Webflow</h2>
<p>Like all of the tools we’ll discuss, Webflow is a relative newcomer to the scene. It’s an in-browser drag-and-drop editor for creating responsive websites without having to stare at code. It requires a monthly subscription and has multiple pricing levels for individuals and teams.</p>
<p>Included in all of the subscriptions is hosting on a content delivery network using a subdomain (yoursite.webflow.com), unless you want to pay a few dollars more for custom domain hosting. But you may also simply export the generated code and take it where you want. How’s the code that Webflow generates, you ask? It’s based on Bootstrap 3.0, and, yes, some of us could write cleaner, lighter, more semantic code, but all told, Webflow’s code is relatively clean.</p>
<p>After you sign up and log in, you get to Webflow’s dashboard. This is where you control your account, manage website settings and start your website. By default, there’s not much except a big blue button staring you in the face, urging you to create a website. You can either use a template or start from scratch. There’s even a marketplace for templates, paid and free, where you can sell your own Webflow templates.</p>
